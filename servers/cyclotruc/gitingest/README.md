# GitIngest 🔍
Turn any Git repository into a prompt-friendly text ingest for LLMs.

You can also replace `hub` with `ingest` in any github url to access the coresponding digest

## 🚀 Features

- **Easy code context**: Get a text digest from a git repository URL or a directory
- **Smart Formatting**: Optimized output format for LLM prompts
- **Statistics about**: :
  - File and directory structure
  - Size of the extract
  - Token count  
- **CLI tool**: Run it as a command (Currently on Linux only)
- **Python package**: Import it in your code


## 📦 Installation

```
pip install gitingest
```


## 💡 Command Line usage

The `gitingest` command line tool allows you to analyze codebases and create a text dump of their contents.

```bash
# Basic usage
gitingest /path/to/directory

# From url
gitingest https://github.com/cyclotruc/gitingest

# See more options
gitingest --help
```

This will write the digest in a text file (default `digest.txt`) in your current working directory.


## 🐛 Python package usage


```python
from gitingest import ingest

summary, tree, content = ingest("path/to/directory")

#or from URL
summary, tree, content = ingest("https://github.com/cyclotruc/gitingest")
```

By default, this won't write a file but can be enabled with the `output` argument
